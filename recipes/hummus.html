    <p>Hummus is a creamy puree of garbanzo beans and tahini (sesame seed paste) 
        seasoned with lemon juice and garlic. It is a popular spread and dip in 
        Greece and throughout the Middle East.

    Ingredients
    <ul>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li> 
        <li>3 tablespoons tahini paste</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 (15.5 ounce) cans garbanzo beans, drained</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely shredded fresh basil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon paprika (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    Directions
    <ol>
        <li>Place garlic, salt, tahini, and lemon juice into a food processor; 
            process until smooth. Pour in the garbanzo beans and 1/2 cup olive oil;
             process until smooth again, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally. 
             Once smooth, add the sun-dried tomatoes, and pulse until they have been 
             chopped to very small pieces and are incorporated into the hummus. 
             Finally, add the basil, and pulse a few times until mixed in. </li>
        <li>Spread the hummus into a shallow serving dish, and make a few 
            decorative grooves on top. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, then drizzle 
            with 2 tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with paprika before 
            serving. </li>
    </ol>
